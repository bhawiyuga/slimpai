When we write 1/2, we're saying:\n- The **bottom number (2)** = how many equal pieces the pizza is cut into\n- The **top number (1)** = how many pieces you get\n\nSo 1/2 means you get 1 piece out of 2 equal pieces - that's half the pizza! üéâ\n\nThink about it:\n- 1/4 = 1 piece out of 4 pieces (a quarter)\n- 2/4 = 2 pieces out of 4 pieces (half)\n- 3/4 = 3 pieces out of 4 pieces (most of it!)",
